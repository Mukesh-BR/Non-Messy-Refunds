# Non-Messy-Refunds
A simple Android/Django app to digitise mess refunds in our college.

The Android app is linked to Firebase which has data of all the students. The app uses a Barcode Scanner API to record attendance. The Django app is used to track students and for students to track their own attendance and thus, their own mess refund status.
